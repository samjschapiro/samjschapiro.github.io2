            <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Introduction</h2>
            <p>We are on the precipice of a scientific revolution in AI. How do theorists explain the remarkable generalization and reasoning abilities exhibited by LLMs? How do we push the generalization abilities of AI systems even further, into areas like scientific and industrial creativity?</p>
            <p>While we don’t yet know the complete answers to these questions, we do know what the type of work that will yield these solutions will look like:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    It will probably come from young people who are newer to the field.
                    <blockquote>
                        Almost always the men who achieve these fundamental inventions of a new paradigm have been either very young or very new to the field whose paradigm they change. And perhaps that point need not have been made explicit, for obviously these are the men who, being little committed by prior practice to the traditional rules of normal science, are particularly likely to see that those rules no longer define a playable game and to conceive another set that can replace them.
                        <br>— Thomas S. Kuhn, <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> (p. 90)
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It will be preceded by rigorous philosophical investigations and debates into the foundations of intelligence that unveil what the new paradigms should look like.
                    <blockquote>
                        The proliferation of competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the expression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to debate over fundamentals, all these are symptoms of a transition from normal to extraordinary research.
                        <br>— Thomas S. Kuhn, <i>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> (p. 91)

            <h2><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Our Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this reading group is to foster the philosophical discussions and inquiry needed to understand what form the next wave of scientific revolutions in AI will take.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="overview">
            <h2><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Overview</h2>
            <p>This reading group is a continuation of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/generalization-phil-and-psych/">Philosophy and Psychology of Generalization and Creativity</a> (PPGC) seminar and reading group at the Simons Institute, UC Berkeley as part of Modern Paradigms in Generalization (MPG) during Fall 2024</p>
            <p>Generalization is roughly “the ability of an intelligent system to perform well on tasks outside of its training data.” The goal of PPGC was to understand how humans generalize, with particular emphasis on generalization during psychogenesis and extraordinary instances of generalization through scientific and industrial creativity. 
                At the same time, we scrutinized landmark works in metaphysics and the philosophy of science to try to arrive at philosophical limits of generalization that can inform modern AI research.</p>
